                <p>
                    <strong>Reel Talk's Vision:</strong><br>
                    Reel Talk is envisioned as a platform that unites Movie & TV-Show enthusiasts, providing a safe space for discussions and discoveries about favorite films and TV shows. It aims to fill a gap that hasn't been adequately addressed, fostering an environment for passionate conversations and exploration of entertainment content. The team's motivation to take charge and execute on this vision led to the creation of Reel Talk.

                    <strong>Project Details:</strong><br>
                    As a Front-End Volunteer Android Developer for Reel Talk, I contributed to the development of the mobile side which is also tied to a web application accessible across iOS, Android, and desktop platforms. The initial launch strategy is focused on iOS followed by Android, with the web version initially serving as a marketing/branding page. I implemented intuitive front-end features using Android Navigation, Material Design, and XML layouts. Utilized with Kotlin, Android Studio, Git/GitHub, Hilt, and LiveData for an engaging user experience. As of now I am actively learning Firebase integration and Google Play Console for enhanced app distribution. We also utilized Scrum/Agile methodologies for effective project management.
