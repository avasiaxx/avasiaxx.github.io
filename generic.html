                <p>
                    <strong>Reel Talk's Vision:</strong><br>
                    Reel Talk is envisioned as a platform that unites Movie & TV-Show enthusiasts, providing a safe space for discussions and discoveries about favorite films and TV shows. It aims to fill a gap that hasn't been adequately addressed, fostering an environment for passionate conversations and exploration of entertainment content. The team's motivation to take charge and execute on this vision led to the creation of Reel Talk.

                <p>
                    <strong>Project Details:</strong><br>
                    As a Front-End Android Developer at Reel Talk, I played a significant role in crafting the Android application, tightly integrated with a web platform accessible across iOS, Android, and desktop devices. Our launch strategy prioritized iOS, followed by Android, while the web version initially functioned as a marketing hub. I orchestrated intuitive front-end features employing Android Navigation, Material Design, and XML layouts. Leveraging Kotlin, Android Studio, Git/GitHub, Hilt, and LiveData ensured an immersive user experience. Currently, I'm actively exploring Firebase integration and Google Play Console for optimized app distribution. The project adopted Scrum/Agile methodologies, ensuring efficient project management
